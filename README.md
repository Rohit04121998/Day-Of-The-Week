# Day-Of-The-Week
This project consists of a verilog code for calculating the day of a week from any given date between the years 1700 to 2300

Calendar is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial or administrative purposes. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events.

Gregorian Calendar is the de facto international standard, and is used almost everywhere in the world for civil purposes. It is a purely solar calendar, with a cycle of leap days in a 400-year cycle designed to keep the duration of the year aligned with the solar year.

Gregorian year has either 365 or 366 days (the leap day being inserted as 29 February), amounting. Calendar was used not only for  timekeeping but also to a specific record or device displaying such a scheme, for example an appointment book in the form of a pocket calendar (or personal organizer), desktop calendar, a wall Calendar etc.
It is common to display the Gregorian calendar in separate monthly grids of seven columns and five to six rows.
